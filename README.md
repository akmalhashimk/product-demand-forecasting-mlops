# üõçÔ∏è Product Demand Forecasting with MLOps

This project implements a scalable, end-to-end machine learning system to forecast daily product sales for multiple retail stores. It covers the entire ML lifecycle including data ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, deployment, monitoring, and retraining.

## üéØ Objective

Accurately forecast daily sales for Rossmann stores using historical sales data, promotions, store characteristics, holidays, and other time-based features. The system is designed to support inventory planning and decision-making at scale.

## üß† Features

- End-to-end pipeline for time-series forecasting
- Feature engineering with temporal, promotional, and store-level data
- Models: XGBoost, LightGBM, TimeSeriesSplit
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- REST API deployment using FastAPI
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Containerization with Docker
- Cloud deployment (GCP/AWS)
- Monitoring with drift detection and retraining pipeline
- Interactive dashboard using Streamlit
